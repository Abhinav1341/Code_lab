## ‚ú® About This Repository

Welcome to **The Coder's Toolkit**! This repository is a community-driven effort to build a comprehensive library of high-quality coding resources. Whether you're learning the fundamentals of data structures or looking for inspiration for your next big project, you'll find valuable code and concepts here.

Our goal is to create a focused, organized, and practical set of essentials that can be used for learning, practice, and interview preparation.

## üß∞ What's Inside?

This repository is organized into two main categories:

* **üß† Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA):** A comprehensive collection of common DSA problems and their solutions. This is the core foundation for efficient and effective programming. We cover everything from basic sorting algorithms to complex graph problems.

* **üõ†Ô∏è Projects:** A growing list of hands-on projects that demonstrate practical, real-world application of your skills. We have projects like:
    * **Code Editor:** A simple, functional code editor built from scratch.
    * *(...and many more to come!)*

## üíª Accepted Languages
